# Population-Genomics

This project was done for the Population Genomics module during my studies (12/07/2023)

The dataset is part of the Raeymaekers et al. (2017) study. The ‘vcf’ file contains 192 samples from three-spined stickleback. There are eight populations from brackish and freshwater habitats and from each site approximately 24 individuals have been sequenced using WGS. Samples have been taken from the Belgian-Dutch lowlands. 

The analysis was done in R (R Studio) for just the chromosome X. In order to isolate from the vcf file, the chromosome X of three spined stickleback I used the command awk in linux and afterwards I compiled the analysis pipeline.
